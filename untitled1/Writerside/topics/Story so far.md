Players have found doomsday clocks. They are counting down to 4719. Meteorite wiped out the ancient world. 10k years later the modern world is catching up to the ancient world before the wipe, but they're still behind in some ways. 

The world is ending in 9 years. Good luck. GGs. The world is ending because of aliens. 


At first we are a group of like adventures that are like. Okay so. We are employed by like sort of like coalition thing that like regroups multiple countries (the pathfinders society but not really but lets just say it's the pathfinder society(but maybe something else)) We did some basic missions, some basic starting missions like. this first mission we encountered an alchemist that may or may not have caused the things in kwbe. We did some basic missions after the basic mission to become known in the network to get a network. After we did a big mission to investigate a village to see what was happening. We figured out the village was fucked up by thousands of mosquitos and it was horrible and there was some time loop things that where we went to a certain place we went forward in time and we lost some shit and we figured out the cause of the problem was well. was well a certain creature known as the mosquito witch, we also found my character but from the future. We got time skipped three years where aliens apparently basically did some weird shit to us and we tried to figure it out. We are now in the city of seven arches that is cursed and we are trying to figure out what is wrong because it gives elves cancer but maybe not cancer and we are trying to figure out if it gives elves cancer.
